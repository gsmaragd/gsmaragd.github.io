<b>Improving Performance and Cost of Content Delivery in a Hyperconnected World</b>
<br><br>
The Internet has become the predominant channel for innovation, disruption, and
for creating new revenue streams. In a hyperconnected world a substantial
fraction of the global population spends more and more time online to work, for
shopping and entertainment, and to get access to information. We are observing
an unprecedented amount of content generated by human activity and popular
application such as web browsing, video streaming, and social networks that has
to be delivered to the hundred of millions of Internet users around the globe.
To cope with the always increasing demand for content, a number of Content
Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been developed to deliver voluminous amount of
content, that originates from content producers, to hundred of millions of
Internet users around the globe. CDNs greatly extend the capabilities of the
Internet by deploying massively distributed infrastructures to accelerate
content delivery. Today, CDNs are responsible for almost half of Internet
traffic. Operation at that scale poses challenges for CDNs as they have to
dynamically map end-users to appropriate servers without being fully aware of
the network conditions within an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or the end-user
location. CDNs also try to minimize their operation cost. Moreover, ISPs
struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the dynamic server
selection policies of the CDNs. In this project we develop systems and study the
necessary incentives to turn the challenges, in terms of performance and cost,
that content delivery stakeholders, including CDNs and ISPs, face separately
into an opportunity for collaboration. We also re-examine the fragile economic
model of the Internet and provide methodologies to study the trade-offs between
peering cost and performance for content delivery. Finally, we propose a radical
approach to push CDN functionality at the edges to deal with today's complex and
personalized content in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.
