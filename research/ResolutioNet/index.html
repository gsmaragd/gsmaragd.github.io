<b>Resolving the Tussle in the Internet: Mapping, Architecture, and Policy Making</b>
<br><br>
The Internet has revolutionalized the way individuals and corporations
communicate, publish, access, and search for information. As our
globally-connected digital civilization increasingly relies on the smooth and
uninterrupted Internet operation, any disruption has a direct negative impact on
both the economy and society. However, the Internet was not designed to serve
its current role nor was foreseen to be a public good. On the contrary, the
Internet was designed to be fully decentralized and thus administrated by the
owners of independent networks. Today, the various Internet stakeholders have
diverse and often conflicting objectives. The term "tussle" was introduced to refer to
this ongoing contention among Internet players with conflicting interests.
Indeed, quite often disputes between Internet players or between them and
governments hit the news and the negative externalities affect the life of
potentially billions of Internet users worldwide and harm innovation on the
Internet.
<br><br>
We propose a research agenda to resolve the tussle on the Internet. First, we
propose the use of sophisticated techniques to collect and analyze massive
network data to unveil the complex interactions among the various Internet
players that lead to disputes and to identify the conditions under which a
resolution is possible. Second, we utilize additional degrees of freedom to
resolve the tussle on the Internet by enabling coordination of the various
Internet players. To this end, we introduce expressiveness of all the involved
parties in existing protocols and enable agile deployment of third-party
services and applications inside operational networks. Third, we contribute to
the Internet policymaking debate by providing an up-to-date view of the state
and health of the Internet as well as providing unbiased recommendations on how
to resolve the Internet tussle. This project is an interdisciplinary effort to
foster a dialogue for Internetâ€™s future and sustainability in light of the
ever-increasing growth and competitiveness in the Internet ecosystem.
