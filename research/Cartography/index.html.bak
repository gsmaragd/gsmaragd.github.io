<p>
Today, a large fraction of Internet traffic is due to content delivery applications 
originated by Content Providers (CPs) such as content distribution networks, 
content producers, hyper-giants and cloud platforms. To cope with the increasing demand
for content, CPs deploy massively distributed infrastructures.
This poses new challenges for the CPs as they
have to dynamically map end-user to the appropriate servers.
This is challenging as CPs are largely unaware of the network
conditions within an ISP as well as the end-users network
locations. Furthermore, ISPs strive to cope with rapid
traffic shifts caused by the dynamic server selection process
of CPs. This is to a lose-lose situation for both CPs and ISPs.
Moreover, end-users are not always assigned to the best servers that leads to optimal end-user performance.
<br><br>
We are developing and evaluating novel architectures and protocols to enable the collaboration between ISPs and
CPs. We argue that it is feasible for both ISPs and CPs to reduce their operational cost, improve their revenue, 
and enable new applications by exchnanging recommendations on the best assignment of users to servers based on their
operational view of the network and hosting infrastructures respectively. By jointly optimizing the network and 
hosting infrastructure, end-user experience is also expected to be improved. 
</p>

    <h2>Provider-aided Distance Information System (PaDIS)</h2>
<p>
To improve end-user assignment to servers, especially from a performance perspective, we propose and deploy a Provider-aided Distance Information System (PaDIS). 
PaDIS is a novel system operated by an ISP that allows them to influence the assignment of users to servers by utilizing information available only to ISPs (network
conditions and end-user location) as well as by exploiting server diversity exposed by the CDN server selection process. PaDIS ranks any user and available CDN server pair based on current network 
conditions and accurate network locations. It then returns back the most preferable servers to the end-user regarding a performance metric chosen by the ISP. 
As a result, PaDIS utilizes the deployed CDN server infrastructure to improve end-user performance. To evaluate the performance improvements we have implemented 
and deployed a PaDIS prototype. Our field test results show that significant improvements in download time up to a factor of four for content offered by popular 
content distributors can be achieved when PaDIS is used.
</p>

  <div class="third">
    <h2>Content-aware Traffic Engineering (CaTE)</h2>
    <p>
We argue that CPs and ISPs can jointly take advantage of the massively deployed distributed
infrastructures to improve their operation and end-user performance.
We propose Content-aware Traffic Engineering (CaTE).
CaTE dynamically changes the traffic demand by utilizing ISP network
information during the server selection process performed by CPs.
With CaTE server selection of CPs is decoupled from content transfer.
Thus, it is possible to augment the server selection strategy of CPs
with information from ISPs about the state of the network, the links
that are traversed and the network location of the users.
To this end, CPs gain a better end-user to server mapping
as network-informed server selection circumvents network bottlenecks.
Our results show significant improvements in end-user performance, 
reduction of the overall traffic in the ISP, 
and decrease in ISP link utilization up to 40% when applying 
CaTE to traffic delivered by the major CPs.
CaTE also enables online negotiations between ISPs and CPs on the 
use of network and hosting resources.

  <div class="third last">
    <h2>ISP-CDN Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
We develop protocols to enable the collaboration between ISPs and CPs without 
the need to reveal sensitive operational information. 
For CDNs, a closer collaboration with an ISP is an imprortant step towards improving
their competitiveness in the content delivery market. ISP-CDN collaboration is 
an enabler for both ISP and CDN to jointly introduce new applications to end-users
by utilizing the global footprint of a CDN and its negotiation power with content producers,
as well as utilizing the customer base of an ISP.
This is a new paradigm for revenue sharing between the two parties.
Turning our attention to cost cutting, both CPs and ISPs will be benefited. 
An ISP can deploy general purpose infrastructure and leverage recent advances in virtualization 
to increase its revenue by co-locating CDNs. The deployment of such infrastructures will help
an ISP to better provision its network, thus, alleviates the need to frequently expand the network. 
In this setting, CDNs can increase their capacity on demand and potentially reduce their operational costs.
Moreover, CDNs can also utilize computation power within the network to enhance current application or
launch new ones.
Furthermore, the offering of richer and more cost-efficient applications to the end-user is also 
expected to improve end-user experience and engagement to the ISP.
