Today, a large fraction of Internet trafﬁc is originated by Content Delivery
Networks (CDNs). To cope with increasing demand for content, CDNs have deployed
massively distributed infrastructures. These deployments pose challenges for
CDNs as they have to dynamically map end-users to appropriate servers without
being fully aware of the network conditions within an Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or the end-user location. On the other hand, ISPs struggle to cope with
rapid traffic shifts caused by the dynamic server selection policies of the
CDNs.
<br><br>
The challenges that CDNs and ISPs face separately can be turned into an
opportunity for collaboration.  For CDNs, a closer collaboration with an ISP is
an important step towards improving their competitiveness in the content
delivery market. For ISPs, it is a step towards better management of the
traffic that flows within their networks. ISP-CDN collaboration is also an enabler for both ISP and
CDN to jointly introduce new applications to end-users by utilizing the global
footprint of a CDN and its negotiation power with content producers, as well as
the customer base of an ISP.  This is a new paradigm for revenue sharing
between the two parties. 
We develop protocols and systems to enable the collaboration between ISPs and CDNs without the need to reveal sensitive
operational information that lead to a win-win situation. By jointly optimizing the network and hosting
infrastructure, end-user experience is also expected to be improved.  </p>
<br>

  <div class="third">
    <h2>Provider-aided Distance Information System (PaDIS)</h2>
<p>
To improve end-user assignment to servers, especially from a performance
perspective, we propose and deploy a Provider-aided Distance Information System
(PaDIS).  PaDIS is a novel system operated by an ISP that allows them to
influence the assignment of users to servers by utilizing information available
only to ISPs (network conditions and end-user location) as well as by
exploiting server diversity exposed by the CDN server selection process. PaDIS
ranks any user and available CDN server pair based on current network
conditions and accurate network locations. It then returns back the most
preferable servers to the end-user regarding a performance metric chosen by the
ISP.  As a result, PaDIS utilizes the deployed CDN server infrastructure to
improve end-user performance. To evaluate the performance improvements we have
implemented and deployed a PaDIS prototype. Our field test results show that
significant improvements in download time up to a factor of four for content
offered by popular content distributors can be achieved when PaDIS is used.
</p>

  <div class="third">
    <h2>Content-aware Traffic Engineering (CaTE)</h2>
    <p>
We argue that CDNs and ISPs can jointly take advantage of the massively
deployed distributed infrastructures to improve their operation and end-user
performance.  We show that it is sufficient for CDNs and ISPs to coordinate
only in server selection, not routing, in order to perform traffic engineering.
To this end, we propose Content-aware Traffic Engineering (CaTE), which
dynamically adapts server selection for content hosted by CDNs using ISP
recommendations on small time scales. CaTE relies on the observation that by
selecting an appropriate server among those available to deliver the content,
the path of the traffic in the network can be inﬂuenced in a desired way. We
present the design and implementation of a prototype to realize CaTE, and show
how CDNs and ISPs can jointly take advantage of the already deployed, path diversity, and
ISP detailed view of the network status without revealing sensitive operational
information. By relying on traces from a large European ISP and the largest
commercial CDN, we show that CaTE allows CDNs to enhance the end-user
experience while enabling an ISP to achieve several trafﬁc engineering goals.
 </p>

  <div class="third last">
    <h2>Network Platform as a Service (NetPaaS)</h2>
    <p>
    Recently, major CDNs have formed strategic alliances with large ISPs to
    provide content delivery network solutions. Such alliances show the natural
    evolution of content delivery today driven by the need to address
    scalability issues and to take advantage of new technology and business
    opportunities. Moreover, major ISPs have announced the deployment of generic appliances (microdatacenters)
    within their networks to support Network Function Virtualization. We revisit the design and operating space of
    ISP-CDN collaboration in light of recent ISP and CDN alliances and advances in network function virtualization. We identify
    two key enablers for supporting collaboration and improving content
    delivery performance: informed end-user to server assignment and in-network
    server allocation. We report on our experience developing and evaluating a
    prototype system, NetPaaS, that materializes them. Relying on traces from
    the largest commercial CDN and a large tier-1 ISP, we show that NetPaaS is
    able to increase CDN capacity on-demand, enable coordination, reduce
    download time, and achieve multiple traffic engineering goals leading to a
    win-win situation for both ISP and CDN.  </p>
