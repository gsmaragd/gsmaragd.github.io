As the Internet continues to grow both in size and in terms of the volume of
traffic it carries, more and more networks in the different parts of the world
are relying on an increasing number of distinct ways to exchange traffic with
one another. As a result, simple questions such as "What is the application mix
in today's Internet?" may produce non-informative simple answers unless they are
refined by specifying the vantage point where the traffic is observed, the
networks that are involved, or even the type of interconnection used.  In this
paper, we revisit the question of the application mix in today's Internet and
make two main contributions. First, we develop a methodology for classifying the
application mix in packet-sampled traces collected at one of the largest IXPs in
Europe and worldwide. We show that our method can classify close to 95% of the
traffic by relying on a stateful classification approach that uses payload
signatures, communication patterns, and port-based classification only as a
fallback. Second, our results show that when viewed from this vantage point and
aggregated over all the IXP's public peering links, the Internet's application
mix is very similar to that reported in other recent studies that relied on
different vantage points, peering links or classification methods. However, the
observed aggregate application mix is by no means representative of the
application mix seen on individual peering links. In fact, we show that the
business type of the ASes that are responsible for much of the IXP's total
traffic has a strong influence on the application mix of their overall traffic
and of the traffic seen on their major peering links.
