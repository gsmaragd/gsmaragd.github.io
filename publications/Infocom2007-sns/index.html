      In a typical overlay network for routing or content
	 sharing, each node must select a fixed number of immediate
	 overlay neighbors for routing traffic or content queries. A selfish
	 node entering such a network would select neighbors so as to
	 minimize the weighted sum of expected access costs to all its
	 destinations. Previous work on selfish neighbor selection has
	 built intuition with simple models where edges are undirected,
	 access costs are modeled by hop-counts, and nodes have potentially
	 unbounded degrees. However, in practice, important
	 constraints not captured by these models lead to richer games
	 with substantively and fundamentally different outcomes. Our
	 work models neighbor selection as a game involving directed
	 links, constraints on the number of allowed neighbors, and costs
	 reflecting both network latency and node preference. We express
	 a node’s “best response” wiring strategy as a k-median problem
	 on asymmetric distance, and use this formulation to obtain pure
	 Nash equilibria. We experimentally examine the properties of
	 such stable wirings on synthetic topologies, as well as on real
	 topologies and maps constructed from PlanetLab and AS-level
	 Internet measurements. Our results indicate that selfish nodes can
	 reap substantial performance benefits when connecting to overlay
	 networks composed of non-selfish nodes. On the other hand, in
	 overlays that are dominated by selfish nodes, the resulting stable
	 wirings are optimized to such great extent that even non-selfish
	 newcomers can extract near-optimal performance through naive
	 wiring strategies.
