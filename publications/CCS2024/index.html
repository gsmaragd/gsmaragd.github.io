Phishing on the web is a model of social engineering and an attack vector for getting access to sensitive and financial
data of individuals and corporations. Phishing has been identified as one of the prime cyber threats in recent years.
With the goal to effectively identifying and combating phishing as early as possible, we present in this paper a
longitudinal analysis of phishing attacks from the vantage point of three country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) reg-
istries that manage more than 8 million active domains â€“ namely the Netherlands' .nl, Ireland's .ie, and Belgium's .be.
We perform a longitudinal analysis on phishing attacks spanning up to 10 years, based on more than 28 thousand phishing
domains. Our results show two major attack strategies: national companies and organizations are far more often
impersonated using malicious registered domains under their country's own ccTLD, which enables better mimicry of the
impersonated company. In stark contrast, interna- tional companies are impersonated using whatever domains that can be
compromised, reducing overall mimicry but bearing no registration and financial costs. Although most research works
focus on detecting new domain names, we show that 80% of phishing attacks in the studied ccTLDs employ compromised
domain names. We find banks, financial institutions, and high-tech giant compa- nies at the top of the most impersonated
targets. We also show the impact of ccTLD's registration and abuse handling policies on preventing and mitigating
phishing attacks, and that mitigation is complex and performed at both web and DNS level at different intermediaries.
Last, our results provide a unique opportunity for ccTLDs to compare and revisit their policies and impacts, with the
goal of improving mitigation procedures.
