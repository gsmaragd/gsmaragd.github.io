	 The effectiveness of service provisioning in largescale
	 networks is highly dependent on the number and location
	 of service facilities deployed at various hosts. The classical,
	 centralized approach to determining the latter would amount
	 to formulating and solving the uncapacitated k-median (UKM)
	 problem (if the requested number of facilities is fixed), or the
	 uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem (if the number
	 of facilities is also to be optimized). Clearly, such centralized
	 approaches require knowledge of global topological and demand
	 information, and thus do not scale and are not practical for large
	 networks. The key question posed and answered in this paper
	 is the following: "How can we determine in a distributed and
	 scalable manner the number and location of service facilities?"
	 We propose an innovative approach in which topology and
	 demand information is limited to neighborhoods, or balls of small
	 radius around selected facilities, whereas demand information is
	 captured implicitly for the remaining (remote) clients outside
	 these neighborhoods, by mapping them to clients on the edge of
	 the neighborhood; the ball radius regulates the trade-off between
	 scalability and performance. We develop a scalable, distributed
	 approach that answers our key question through an iterative reoptimization
	 of the location and the number of facilities within
	 such balls. We show that even for small values of the radius (1 or 2), 
	 our distributed approach achieves performance under various
	 synthetic and real Internet topologies that is comparable to that
	 of optimal, centralized approaches requiring full topology and
	 demand information.
