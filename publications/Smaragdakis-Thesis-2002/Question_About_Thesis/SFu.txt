Hi Rajashree,

thank you for your interest.

Unfortunately I do not have my simulations
available as it was a combined work with 
other people and my contribution was on
applying statistical techniques in UMTS.
Unfortunately I am not still active in this
project (3 years now). I can try to find the 
traces but I can promise anything :(

My solution was based on the following papers
(which I highly recomend to model/understand 
losses in UMTS):

M. Zorzi,M. Rossi,G. Mazzini, Throughput and energy performance of TCP
on a Wideband CDMA air Interface , WCDMA for UMTS : radio access for
third generation mobile communications , John Wiley , 2000.

M. Zorzi ,G. Mazzini, V. Tralli, A. Giovanardi, Some results on the
error statistics over a WCDMA air interface , in Proc. MMT2000,
Florida(USA),Dec. 2000.


Moreover, when I run the experiments there was NO UMTS simulations
so my approach was to create losses following the pattents described
in the above papers. 

Today there are a UMTS modules available and I recond to use one 
of them eg:
UMTS simulators
--------------
- EURANE UMTS simulator by European Commission 5th framework project
  SEACORN 
- UMTS simulator by Alfredo Todini and Francesco Vacirca 
- UTRAN/UMTS simulations by Pablo Martin and Paula Ballester at University
  of Strathclyde, United Kingdom
- Linkopings Universitet UMTS implementation 
(for more info go this page:
http://cchen1.et.ntust.edu.tw/students/master2005.htm
and search for UMTS simulator) 

you can also have a look at this commercial tool:

If you have any question please do not hesitate to send
me an e-mail.

Hoping to help you,

-- George
