Many emerging scientific and industrial applications
require transferring multiple Tbytes of data on a daily basis.
Examples include pushing scientific data from particle 
accelerators/colliders to laboratories around the world, synchronizing
data-centers across continents, and replicating collections of high
definition videos from events taking place at different timezones.
A key property of all above applications is their ability
to tolerate delivery delays ranging from a few hours to a
few days. Such Delay Tolerant Bulk (DTB) data are currently
being serviced mostly by the postal system using hard drives
and DVDs, or by expensive dedicated networks. In this work
we propose transmitting such data through commercial ISPs
by taking advantage of already-paid-for off-peak bandwidth
resulting from diurnal traffic patterns and percentile pricing.
We show that between sender-receiver pairs with small timezone
difference, simple source scheduling policies are able to
take advantage of most of the existing off-peak capacity. When
the time-zone difference increases, taking advantage of the full
capacity requires performing store-and-forward through intermediate
storage nodes. We present an extensive evaluation of the
two options based on traffic data from 200+ links of a large transit
provider with PoPs at three continents. Our results indicate that
there exists huge potential for performing multi Tbyte transfers
on a daily basis at little or no additional cost.
