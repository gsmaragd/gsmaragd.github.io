	 The distributed partitioning of autonomous, self-aware nodes into
	 cooperative groups, within which scarce resources could be effectively
	 shared for the benefit of the group, is increasingly emerging as a
	 hallmark of many newly-proposed overlay and peer-to-peer applications.
	 Distributed caching protocols in which group members cooperate to
	 satisfy local requests for objects is a canonical example of such
	 applications. In recent work of ours we identified mistreatment
	 as a potentially serious problem for nodes participating in such
	 cooperative caching arrangements. Mistreatment materializes when a
	 node's access cost for fetching objects worsens as a result of
	 cooperation.  To that end, we outlined an emulation-based framework
	 for the development of mistreatment-resilient distributed selfish
	 caching schemes. Under this framework, a node opts to participate in
	 the group only if its individual access cost is less than the one
	 achieved while in isolation.  In this paper, we argue against the use
	 of such static ``all or nothing" approaches which force an
	 individual node to either join or not join a cooperative
	 group. Instead, we advocate the use of a smoother approach, whereby
	 the level of cooperation is tied to the benefit that a node begets
	 from joining a group. To that end, we propose a distributed and easily
	 deployable feedback-control scheme which mitigates mistreatment. Under
	 our proposed adaptive scheme, a node independently emulates its
	 performance as if it were acting in a greedy local manner and then adapts its caching
	 policy in the direction of reducing its measured access cost below its
	 emulated greedy local cost. Using control-theoretic analysis, we show that
	 our proposed scheme converges to the minimal access cost, and indeed
	 outperforms any static scheme. We also show that our scheme results in
	 insignificant degradation to the performance of the caching group
	 under typical operating scenaria.
