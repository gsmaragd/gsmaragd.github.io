      Although cooperation generally increases the amount of resources
	 available to a community of nodes, thus improving individual and
	 collective performance, it also allows for the appearance of
	 potential mistreatment problems through the exposition of one node's
	 resources to others.  We study such concerns by considering a group
	 of independent, rational, self-aware nodes that cooperate using
	 on-line caching algorithms, where the exposed resource is the
	 storage at each node. Motivated by content networking
	 applications -- including web caching, CDNs, and P2P -- this paper
      extends our previous work on the off-line version of the problem,
      which was conducted under a game-theoretic framework, and limited to
      object replication. We identify and investigate two causes of
      mistreatment: (1) cache state interactions (due to the
      cooperative servicing of requests) and (2) the adoption of a
	 common scheme for cache management policies. Using analytic
	 models, numerical solutions of these
	 models, as well as simulation experiments, we show that on-line
	 cooperation schemes using caching are fairly robust to mistreatment
	 caused by state interactions. To appear in a substantial manner, the
	 interaction through the exchange of miss-streams has to be very
	 intense, making it feasible for the mistreated nodes to detect and
	 react to exploitation. This robustness ceases to exist when
	 nodes fetch and store objects in response to remote requests, 
      i.e., when they operate as Level-2 caches (or proxies) for other
      nodes.  Regarding mistreatment due to a common scheme, we show that
      this can easily take place when the ``outlier'' characteristics of
      some of the nodes get overlooked. This finding underscores the
      importance of allowing cooperative caching nodes the flexibility of
      choosing from a diverse set of schemes to fit the peculiarities of
      individual nodes. To that end, we outline an emulation-based
      framework for the development of mistreatment-resilient distributed
      selfish caching schemes.
