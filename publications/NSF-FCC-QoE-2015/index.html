As more large content/cloud and service providers are making
colocation facilities that house an Internet eXchange Point
(IXP) their location-of-choice for interconnecting with one
another in an effort to shrink the physical as well as network
distances between where content resides and where it
is consumed, the providers of these facilities and/or the operators
of the co-located IXPs are reacting by constantly innovating
and expanding their interconnection service offerings.
These developments directly impact the long-standing
public vs private peering debate, and performing a rigorous
measurement study that provides a solid understanding of
the actual rather than the perceived cost-performance tradeoffs
between the different interconnection service offerings
that are available to networks in today's Internet in one and
the same colocation facility would go a long way towards
putting this debate on scientifically solid foundations. In particular,
we argue that an important first step towards achieving
this goal is to establish a proven set of measurement
methods and techniques to infer both the existence and type
of the different interconnections that the networks in a colocation
facility with an IXP presence have established with
one another. In fact, any realistic assessment of applicationlevel
performance and user-perceived quality-of-experience
of the traffic that is routed through such a facility will rely
critically on our ability to infer the existence and usage of
the established interconnections in that facility.
