	A foundational issue underlying many overlay network applications
	ranging from routing to P2P file sharing is that of connectivity
	management, i.e., folding new arrivals into the existing mesh and
	re-wiring to cope with changing network conditions.  Previous work has
	considered the problem from two perspectives: devising practical
	heuristics for specific applications designed to work well in real
	deployments, and providing abstractions for the underlying problem
	that are tractable to address via theoretical analyses, especially
	game-theoretic analysis.  Our work unifies these two thrusts first by
	distilling insights gleaned from clean theoretical models, notably
	that under natural resource constraints, selfish players can select
	neighbors so as to efficiently reach near-equilibria that also provide
	high global performance.  Using Egoist, a prototype overlay routing
	system we implemented on PlanetLab, we demonstrate that our neighbor
	selection primitives significantly outperform existing heuristics on a
	variety of performance metrics; that Egoist is competitive with an
	optimal, but unscalable full-mesh approach; and that it remains highly
	effective under significant churn.  We also describe variants of
	Eegoist's current design that would enable it to scale to overlays of
	much larger scale and allow it to cater effectively to applications,
	such as P2P file sharing in unstructured overlays, based on the use of
	primitives such as scoped-flooding rather than routing.
