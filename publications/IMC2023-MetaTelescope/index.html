Unsolicited traffic sent to advertised network space that does not host active
services provides insights about misconfigurations as well as potentially
malicious activities, including the spread of Botnets, DDoS campaigns, and
exploitation of vulnerabilities. Network telescopes have been used for many
years to monitor such unsolicited traffic. Unfortunately, they are limited by
the available address space for such tasks and, thus, limited to specific
geographic and/or network regions.
<br><br>
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept to broadly capture unsolicited
Internet traffic, which we call a ``meta-telescope''. A meta-telescope is based on
the intuition that, with the availability of appropriate vantage points, one
can (i) infer which address blocks on the Internet are unused and (ii) capture
traffic towards themâ€”both without having control of such address blocks. From
this intuition, we develop and evaluate a methodology for identifying unlikely
to be used Internet address space and build a meta- telescope that has very
desirable properties, such as broad coverage of dark space both in terms of size
and topological placement. Such meta-telescope identifies and captures
unsolicited traffic to more than 350k /24 blocks in more than 7k ASes. Through
the analysis of background radiation towards these networks, we also highlight
that unsolicited traffic differs by destination network/geographic re- gion as
well as by network type. Finally, we discuss our experience and challenges when
operating a meta-telescope in the wild.
