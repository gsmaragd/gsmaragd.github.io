Industrial control systems have enabled the digitalization and automation of industrial production and
services, such as electric powerhouses, the electric grid,
and water supply networks. Due to their critical role, any
exposure to the public Internet makes them vulnerable to
attacks that may have catastrophic implications.
<br><br>
In this paper, we report that the readily available
application-layer scanning on all ports opens new avenues
to assess the exposure of devices that run industrial control
protocols that were not possible with previously proposed
active port scanning. We consider 17 widely used industrial control system protocols and develop a methodology
that unveils around 150 thousand industrial control systems
exposed around the globe. Our study shows that many
allegedly exposed industrial control systems are honeypots
that emulate industrial protocols. Our methodology infers
the presence of honeypots and classifies them into three
tiers based on the confidence that these act as honeypots:
low-, medium-, and high-confidence. We classify them thanks
to large-scale application-layer scanning on all ports and
multiple independent attributes, including network information, 
number of open ports, and known honeypot signatures.
Our results show that 15% to 25% of the exposed industrial
control systems are honeypots (with two-thirds of them
belonging to the medium- or high-confidence categories).
Our results challenge previous reports on the prevalence
and distribution of exposed industrial control systems. The
developed methodology enables industry operators to assess
exposed assets and aid protection teams in creating stealthier
honeypots.
